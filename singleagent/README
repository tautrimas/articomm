*******************

Just to view DEMO:
1. Run ./animateagent

To start demo evolution:
1. Run ./main
2. Stop execution with 01 in stop file (program checks it once in a several seconds)
3. Run ./animateagent
NOTE: for agent to complete the task completely, it must reach at least 44000 points. Try running articomm several times. "continue" file has 1 if you want to continue evolution from previous state after stop or ctrl-c.

To compile main.cpp and animateagent.cpp use g++ compiling strings present in those files' comments.
