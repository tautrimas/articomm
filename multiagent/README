About:

This project is about demonstrating the power of AI. 5 totaly dumb robots are being placed on the map and are evolved to perform a task of travelling to designated point on the map. Basicaly all robots must travel to the other end of the sandbox as fast as possible and stay on destination as closely at possible upon arrival. You, the user, are being shown evolution phase (increasing fitness value of 5 robots) and visualization of last best variant when you hit ENTER.

>>Just to view DEMO:
1. Run ./animateagent

>>To start demo evolution:
1. Run ./main
  NOTE: you can run ./main 8 and that will spawn 8 threads for
  simulations. You may experiment on the number as much as you like. Default is 6.
2. Stop execution with ENTER
3. Run ./animateagent

>>Compilation
1. To compile evolution part run "make evolution".
2. To compile animation run: "make animation".

NOTE:
When evolution takes place, columns are:
1. Simulations passed.
2. When new population will be spawned.
3. Speed in ms per simulation.
--
Then populations follow with 2 collumns each:
1. Population size.
2. Best member fitness.

Have fun!

P.S. It runs faster on lightweight terminals (;
