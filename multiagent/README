>>Just to view DEMO:
1. Run ./animateagent

>>To start demo evolution:
1. Run ./main
  NOTE: you can run ./main 8 and that will spawn 8 threads for
  simulations. You may experiment on the number as much as you like. Default is 6.
2. Stop execution with ENTER
3. Run ./animateagent

>>Compilation
1. To compile evolution part run "make evolution".
2. To compile animation run: "make animation".

NOTE:
When evolution takes place, columns are:
1. Simulations passed.
2. When new population will be spawned.
3. Speed in ms per simulation.
--
Then populations follow with 2 collumns each:
1. Population size.
2. Best member fitness.

Have fun!
