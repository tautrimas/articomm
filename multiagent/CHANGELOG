Multi-Agent 1.2.2
  + 20% speed gain because of aproximated trigonometry and sigmoid functions

Multi-Agent 1.2.0
  * Speed measurements
  + Even more optimizations and partly rewriten physics engine
  + Formated output a lot
  + Bug fix for infinite loop
  + No more than 3 populations on the screen
  + Can set thread count for simulations at command line
  
Multi-Agent 1.1.5
  * Multiple core support! Speed doubles or quadruples depending on a processor onboard.
  + More other optimizations
  + More info in README

Multi-Agent 1.1.0
  * Used profiler and optimized most used functions with "inline". Speed gain â€“ over 20%.
  * This version uses 5 robots instead of 3.

Multi-Agent 1.0.1
  Changes from Single Agent 1.2-alpha
  * Many robots!!!
  * Now evolution is terminated with a keypress of ENTER
  * New evolution algorithm has been implemented (Parameter-less Genetic Algorithm)
  + Physics engine now supports collision detection (although with infinite friction)
  - Animateagent degraded due to new program structure, but will be fixed in the future
