***This is an old project of mine for experimenting with AI and Genetic Algorithms. Stored for archival purposes.***

Project for creating intelligent agents with evolved neural networks that are visualised using OpenGL. 
Main purpose is to create communities of agents and observe the way they interact so that it would be possible
to compare the results with the ones that are visible in nature.
